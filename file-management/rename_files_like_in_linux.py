###With this Python script, you can provide a Perl-like regular expression as a search pattern, a replacement pattern, and a list of files as arguments.

###Here's an example of a Python script to accomplish this:

# filename: rename_files.py

import os
import re
import sys
import glob

def rename_files(search_pattern, replacement_pattern, files):
    compiled_pattern = re.compile(search_pattern)
    for filepath in files:
        base_name = os.path.basename(filepath)
        new_name = re.sub(compiled_pattern, replacement_pattern, base_name)
        if new_name != base_name:
            new_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(filepath), new_name)
            os.rename(filepath, new_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 4:
        print(f'Usage: python {sys.argv[0]} [search_pattern] [replacement_pattern] [file_glob]...')
    else:
        files = []
        for file_glob in sys.argv[3:]:
            files.extend(glob.glob(file_glob))
        rename_files(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], files)
        print('File renaming operation completed.')
###In this script, you provide a Perl-like regular expression as the search pattern, a replacement pattern and one or more glob-style file paths as command line arguments. For example, 

###if you saved the script as "rename_files.py" and you wanted to change all the files in the current directory that start with "oldname" to start with "newname" instead, you would run:

###python rename_files.py '^oldname' 'newname' './oldname*'


###Make sure to replace '^oldname', 'newname', and './oldname*' with your search pattern, replacement pattern, and file glob(s). This example assumes you are in the directory containing the files you wish to rename. If the files are in a different directory, you should provide the correct path in the file glob argument.
